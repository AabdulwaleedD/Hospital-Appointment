Hospital Appointment Analytics Dashboard

Healthcare Data Analytics | SQL · Power BI

#📌 Project Overview

This project presents a healthcare analytics dashboard built to support executive, clinical, and financial decision-making in a hospital setting.

The dashboard combines patient risk indicators, clinical outcomes, hospital utilization, and billing performance into a clear, executive-ready reporting solution.

The analysis focuses on transparency, clinical relevance, and financial clarity, rather than cosmetic metrics.

#🎯 Objectives

The dashboard was designed to answer the following questions:

How much total revenue is generated from hospital appointments?

How many patients are classified as high risk?

What is the average length of hospital stay?

Which medical conditions have higher average treatment costs?

How do admission types (Elective, Urgent, Emergency) affect patient volume and revenue?

How are clinical test results distributed across conditions?

#📊 Dashboard Structure
📌 Page 1: Executive Overview & Clinical Insights

This page provides a high-level hospital performance view combined with core clinical indicators.

Key KPIs

Total Revenue: $1.42B

High-Risk Patients: 8.9K

Average Length of Stay: 15.5 days

Average Cost per Patient: $25.54K

The average length of stay reflects all admissions, including emergency and long-stay cases.

Clinical & Operational Insights

Patient distribution by admission type (Elective, Urgent, Emergency)

Average billing amount by medical condition, highlighting cost-intensive conditions

Patient test results by medical condition (Normal, Inconclusive, Abnormal)

High-risk patient distribution by gender, showing a relatively balanced split

Patient volume by doctor, supporting workload and resource analysis

Key Insight:

Emergency and chronic cases contribute significantly to higher patient risk and longer hospital stays.

#📌 Page 2: Financial Insights

This page focuses on billing performance and cost behavior across hospital operations.

Financial Analysis Includes:

Total billing amount by admission type, showing revenue contribution

Billing amount by insurance provider, identifying payer exposure

Average billing by length of stay buckets, clearly showing cost escalation as hospital stays increase

Billing trends over time, supporting financial performance monitoring

Key Financial Insight:

Longer hospital stays are associated with higher average billing amounts, indicating increased resource utilization.

🧠 High-Risk Patient Logic

Patients are classified as High Risk based on indicators visible in the dashboard, including:

Abnormal clinical test results

Extended length of hospital stay

Elevated billing amounts relative to overall averages

This approach supports both clinical prioritization and operational planning.
